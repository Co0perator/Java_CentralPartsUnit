# Java_CentralPartsUnit

This work is by Miles Potter under the GNU GPLv3.0 license

Documentation is coming soon, but the library is currently not very large and not yet complete, so feel free to look through and make a pull request if you'd like
to.

Other language support is coming soon, most likely C++ and Python first.

This edition of Java_CentralPartsUnit is function oriented. An object oriented version is coming soon
or may already be released on my GitHub (https://github.com/Co0perator).
